And then we put Kevin in the padded room. and the padding was filled with 
gold. and the gold was so soft. so very soft. but it was still gold.

and the duck went quack and laid some eggs, and and the duck and kevin had 
waffles. and the waffles were golden brown, but not gold, unlike the padding.

the duck, however, was gold, but it it laid feather eggs. they were not tasty; the waffles were tasty.
